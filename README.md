## Hi there 👋

I am Plamen and I use the nickname Aesperus. I am looking to get back to the world of programming after a long absence.

---
🌐 I believe that any form of programming skill is invaluable in the modern world. 
To that end, regardless of career path, my goal is to train, practice and improve logic, critical thinking and
problem-solving skills and to use that knowledge to keep my mind sharp.

---
🔭 I’m currently working through a full-stack engineer course at Codecademy and the GitHub Skills excercises.

---
🛠 My current toolset:
-  C/C++, C#
-  HTML, CSS, JavaScript
-  GitHub operations
-  Markdown
-  a11y and ARIA
-  PERN - PostgreSQL, Express.js, React, Node

---
🧭 I'm looking forward to:
- expanding my knowledge about full-stack development into other languages and technologies
- getting back into the flow of C/C++/C# development
- getting into the habit of practicing my skills via Leetcode or similar platforms
